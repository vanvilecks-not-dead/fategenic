# Fategenic: A Fate Dice Roller

## Introduction

Fategenic is a tool designed to help Fate game players easily roll and modify Fate dice rolls, and also keep a record of their roll data history.

## Features

Fategenic has four features:

- Rolling dice;

- Adding modifiers;

- Making a roll result card;

- Storing roll data history.

There’s also a plan to add other features, such as graph visualisation of roll results and presets for characters’ Traits.

## Rolling dice

To roll the dice, simply open the website and the dice will be automatically rolled for you. If you want to roll the dice again, click the "Roll Again" button. The results of each roll will be displayed on the screen.

## Adding modifiers to the roll result

After the dice have been rolled, you can add modifiers to the roll result by clicking on the plus and minus signs located on either side of the "Modify Roll" button. Each click will increase or decrease the modifier value by one. The maximum modified roll result is +8, and the minimum is -4.

## Making a roll result card

This feature takes the roll result and creates a card with the result of a roll. Once the card is generated, it can be copied to the user's clipboard and shared with others. The card can also include additional information, such as the roll modifiers.

## Storing roll data history

Fategenic also stores a history of your roll data. Each time you roll the dice, the app records the roll result and any modifiers applied.

## Usage

To use Fategenic, follow these steps:

1. Open the web app in your preferred web browser.

2. The dice will be automatically rolled for you on the opening of the website. If you want to roll the dice again, click the "Roll Again" button.
